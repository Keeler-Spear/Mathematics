# Mathematics
This project contains all of my non-academic programming related to math. Currently, I am implementing methods relevant to linear algebra!
All the linear algebra calculations contained in this project are based on the formulas found in Linear Algebra and Its Applications (Sixth Edition) by David C. Lay, Steven R. Lay, and
Judi J. McDonald. A free version of the text can be found at: https://www.pearson.wolframcloud.com/obj/eTexts/LA6Cloud/6616c834174039112795079e2b5b34c3.nb.

Current ToDos:
1. Row-reduced echelon form calculator
2. Inverse of a square matrix
3. Eigenvalue and eigenvector approximators
4. Vector operations
5. Vector subspaces
